/// Represents a single staff (line of music) containing an ordered list of
/// [Measure]s.
///
/// A [Staff] is the top-level musical container passed to [MusicScore] and
/// [LayoutEngine]. Measures are laid out left-to-right and wrapped into
/// systems automatically by the layout engine.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final staff = Staff(measures: [
///   Measure()
///     ..add(Clef())
///     ..add(TimeSignature(numerator: 4, denominator: 4))
///     ..add(Note(pitch: const Pitch(step: 'C', octave: 4),
///               duration: const Duration(DurationType.quarter))),
/// ]);
/// ```
class Staff {
  /// All measures in this staff, in chronological order.
  final List<Measure> measures;

  /// Full part/staff name shown at the first system.
  final String? name;

  /// Short part/staff name shown on later systems when available.
  final String? abbreviation;

  /// Number of staff lines. Defaults to 5 (CMN). Valid values per MEI:
  /// - 1: percussion / single-line notetion
  /// - 4: 4-string tablature / some historical notetions
  /// - 5: standard CMN (default)
  /// - 6: guitar tablature
  /// Corresponds to the `lines` attribute of `<staffDef>` in MEI v5.
  final int lineCount;

  /// Creates a [Staff] with the given [measures] list.
  ///
  /// [lineCount] defaults to 5 (standard CMN staff). Set to 1 for percussion,
  /// 4 for 4-string tablature, or 6 for guitar tablature.
  ///
  /// If [measures] is omitted an empty list is used, and measures can be
  /// added later via [add].
